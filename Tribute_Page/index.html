      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Thomas Sankara's life:</h3>
      <ul>

        <li>
          <strong>1966</strong> - He entered the military academy of Kadiogo in Ouagadougou with the academy's first intake of 1966 at the age of 17.
          While there he witnessed the first military coup d'état in Upper Volta led by Lieutenant-Colonel Sangoulé Lamizana (3 January 1966).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1970</strong> -  20 year old Sankara went on for further military studies at the military academy of Antsirabe (Madagascar), from which he graduated as a junior officer in 1973. 
          At the Antsirabe academy, the range of instruction went beyond standard military subjects, which allowed Sankara to study agriculture.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1974</strong> - He fought in a border war between Upper Volta and Mali by 1974. 
          He earned fame for his heroic performance in the border war with Mali, but years later would renounce the war as "useless and unjust", a reflection of his growing political consciousness.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1976</strong> - He became commander of the Commando Training Centre in Pô. In the same year he met Blaise Compaoré in Morocco.
           During the presidency of Colonel Saye Zerbo, Sankara was part of a group of young officers who formed a secret organisation called the "Communist Officers' Group".
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1981</strong> - Sankara was appointed Minister of Information in Saye Zerbo's military government in September 1981.
          He resigned on 12 April 1982 in opposition to what he saw as the regime's anti-labour drift, declaring "Misfortune to those who gag the people!".
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1983</strong> - Sankara became Prime Minister in January 1983, after another coup (7 November 1982) brought to power Major-Doctor Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo, but he was dismissed (17 May). 
          In between those four months, Sankara pushed Ouédraogo's regime for more progressive reforms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1983</strong> - A coup d'état organised by Blaise Compaoré made Sankara President on 4 August 1983 at the age of 33. 
          The coup d'état was supported by Libya, which was at the time on the verge of war with France in Chad (see history of Chad).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1983- 1985</strong> -From 1983 to 1985, reforms such as vaccination of 2 million Burkinabes, Appointment of women leaders to cabinet positions, Establishing Peoples Revolutionary Tribunals etc take place.

        <li>
          <strong>1985</strong> - In 1985, Burkina Faso organised a general population census. During the census, some Fula camps in Mali were visited by mistake by Burkinabé census agents.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1987</strong> - Sankara gave a speech marking and honouring the 20th anniversary of Che Guevara's 9 October 1967 execution, one week before his own assassination on 15 October 1987.

        <li><strong>1987</strong> - On 15 October 1987, Sankara was killed by an armed group with twelve other officials in a coup d'état organized by his former colleague Blaise Compaoré.
           When accounting for his overthrow, Compaoré stated that Sankara jeopardized foreign relations with former colonial power France and neighbouring Ivory Coast, and accused his former comrade of plotting to assassinate opponents.
           Sankara's body was riddled with bullets to the back and he was quickly buried in an unmarked grave while his widow Mariam and two children fled the nation.
          </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1987</strong> - Compaoré ateps into power and immediately reversed the nationalizations, overturned nearly all of Sankara's policies, rejoined the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to bring in "desperately needed" funds to restore the "shattered" economy and ultimately spurned most of Sankara's legacy. 
          Compaoré's dictatorship remained in power for 27 years until it was overthrown by popular protests in 2014.
        </li>
        <li>

          “The final debt I owe him was reawakening my faith that Africa will continue to always have a hero, no matter how many traitors abound.
           I will do injustice by attempting a deconstruction of what Thomas Sankara stood for. ”
